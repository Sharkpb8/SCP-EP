## How to play
1. Run `SCP_Extraction_protocol.exe`
2. After the game starts select play
3. Now your goal is to open the large doors, and to do that you need to activate 3 power switches and then the main one
4. To find all power switches you need to look around the map (I attached the map of the game to the project folder for easier navigation)
5. After all 3 power switches are powered activate the main one to open the large door
6. Then go to the next area and find the level 5 keycard to reach the finish
7. Keycards are located in SCP containment cells
8. After obtaining the level 5 keycard open the final door and pick up the secret files
